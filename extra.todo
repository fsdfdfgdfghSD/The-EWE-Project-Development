-- Building:
TODO: Write a Makefile that moves the precompiled binaries into the destination folder, for instance on linux it would be: /bin/ewe and the "ewe" directory will be exported in .bashrc.
I will be also writing a man-page for the linux users about calling ewe commands and so on, to call them you'll write `ewe/md --version` for example, so i don't mix them up with gnu's
core utilities.

TODO: Write a manual similar to `man`, named `ewe`, but for my core utilities.
The ewe-manual should use `less` for displaying output, see more: `man 1 less`, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page
